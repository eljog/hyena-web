Welcome to Kerala Club Seattle! We are a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that organizes and supports a variety of cultural, sports, youth, and charity activities for Keralite Americans in the Pacific Northwest.

Our primary mission is to promote a healthy lifestyle for Keralite Americans in Seattle and the Northwestern USA by providing a platform to engage in outdoor activities throughout the year. At Kerala Club Seattle, we believe that promoting a healthy lifestyle is not just about physical fitness but also about imparting life skills and training to the next generation of young Keralite Americans.

We are dedicated to fostering the spirit of sportsmanship and unity among our community members, and we do so by organizing a variety of sports and youth activities throughout the year.
