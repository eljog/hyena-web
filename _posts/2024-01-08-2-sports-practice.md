Since our founding on September 15th, 2013, Kerala Club Seattle has been committed to serving the Keralite American community in the Pacific Northwest.

We are proud to have built a strong network of members and volunteers who are passionate about promoting our cultural heritage and supporting our community through charitable endeavors. As a non-profit organization, Kerala Club Seattle relies on the generosity of our members and donors to support our activities and events.

We are committed to maintaining transparency and accountability in all our financial transactions, and we are dedicated to using our resources to make a positive impact in the lives of Keralite Americans in the Pacific Northwest.
